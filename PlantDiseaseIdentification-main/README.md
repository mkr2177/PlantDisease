# Plant Disease Identification

## Background

* Plant diseases significantly impact crop yield, quality, and overall agricultural production. Timely detection and treatment of these diseases are crucial to prevent widespread crop damage and economic losses
* Present methods to identify diseases in plants rely on visual inspection by experts, which can be time-consuming and might not scale efficiently in large agricultural settings.

## Solution

* Employing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to build a model which can detect plant diseases from early stage images
* The CNN model's capacity to learn high-level representations from images showcases the potential for improved agricultural practices through early disease detection and precise treatment.
* Implementing such models through mobile applications can facilitate on-the-spot disease diagnosis, empowering farmers with quick, accurate, and actionable information to safeguard their crops.
